  T. Austin-Sparks
  A Witness and a Testimony, May 1943<br /><br/>
Dear Linda,<br>
Loving greetings to you!
I was saddened when I read today’s article, The “Last” Louisville Reunion on your ChristAsUs website this morning. 
Although I had not personally been fortunate enough to attend any of the reunions, I was always blessed by the “good report” that I received concerning the meetings.  I am reminded of the most familiar scripture, “Except a grain  of wheat falls  into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone, but if it dies, it bears much fruit” (John 12:24/NASV).   
The results of the Louisville Reunion will continue to live on in the hearts and lives of those who have been touched by the “word of the Lord” that was spoken, and the fellowship that was enjoyed by those who had the privilege to attend the meetings will live in the hearts and lives of those who were privileged to attend the “family” reunions.
It is quite easy to “lay to rest” that which has once been alive and is now dead, but to lay down that which is still bearing fruit in the lives of those who have been recipients of sharing that Life together is much more difficult, yet we know that “there is an appointed time for everything….” (Ecclesiastes 3:1) and we must all be obedient to the prompting of the Holy Spirit. 
I am sorry that my wife and I were never was able to attend any of the reunions, but we rejoice with those whose lives were spiritually impacted as they came and received “the good seed” that shall continue to bring forth a harvest in its appointed time.
Our love and greetings to you and John.  You are a blessing!<br>
Much love in Christ,</p>
